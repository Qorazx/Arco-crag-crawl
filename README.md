# Arco-crag-crawl
This project is trying to scrape all climbing crags near Arco while also trying to access the earliest date the routes where published. 

Current issue: Accessing route information is not possible. Logging in to access it by creating a session is the idea, however, I don't know how to check if logging in works. I always get Check_form() or check_session() errors.
